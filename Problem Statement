Routing of telephone calls
Some telephone operators have submitted their price lists including price per minute for different phone number prefixes. The price lists look like this:
Operator A:
1 0.9
268 5.1
46 0.17
4620 0.0
468 0.15
4631 0.15
4673 0.9
46732 1.1
Operator B:
1 0.92
44 0.5
46 0.2
467 1.0
48 1.2
And so on...
The left column represents the telephone prefix (country + area code) and the right column represents the operators price per minute for a number starting with that prefix. When several prefixes match the same number, the longest one should be used. If you, for example, dial +46-73-212345 you will have to pay $ 1.1/min with Operator A and $ 1.0/min with Operator B.
If a price list does not include a certain prefix you cannot use that operator to dial numbers starting with that prefix. For example it is not possible to dial +44 numbers with operator A but it is possible with Operator B.
